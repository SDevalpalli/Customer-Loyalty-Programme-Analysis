# Customer Loyalty Programme

The business objective of this project is to come up with an analysis to help in making a decision to continue the existing loyalty programme(Prism+) or make a few changes or completely scrap it. Taking several factors into consideration and deep analysis, we have come up with a suggestion to restructure the current model.

Currently, the model is based on pseudo-random positioning of customers, who have made at least one purchase before 2022, into different tiers. The higher frequency of their purchases, the higher probability they end up in a higher tier with larger discounts.

Our analysis shows that this positioning has not been the most beneficial. Looking at the insights, they show that since the launch of the loyalty program, revenue and the number of customers has dropped, but surprisingly, ARPU has increased across all tiers, indicating that only a fraction of customers assigned as Prism+ members find this program useful. Hence, we believe that the current model, at least in its current shape, should be amended.

In the following sections, we introduce our recommendations that would transform our loyalty program into an impactful, revenue-driving model.
Problem

* Total revenue for Gold and Platinum tiers reduced after 6 months of the Prism+ pilot scheme: -£180 for Gold and -£10,500 for Platinum.
* Number of transactions decreased for all tiers following the Prism+ pilot: -31% for Bronze, -32% for Silver, -36% for Gold, and -46% for Platinum.
* Prism+ members had £6.70 lower average gross profit and 13% lower average gross profit margin compared to non-Prism+ members.  
* Despite a decreased revenue, ARPU has increased for all tiers (+£17.83 for Bronze, +£22.15 for Silver, +£17.25 for Gold, and +£9.37 for Platinum), suggesting only a minority of Prism+ members found it useful to purchase more. 
Recommendations
We advocate for Prism to not entirely scrap the loyalty scheme, but to make amendments to how customers are treated, based on their respective tier. This would require postponing the initial launch date and suggest a new pilot scheme for the restructured Prism+. The table below shows a suggestion for the restructuring of Prism+:

Prism+ tiers  | Criteria  |Rewards 
:---: | :---: | :---:
Bronze| First Purcahse| Welcome/birthday reward for Prism products 
Silver| Spend £100 within 6 months|  Welcome/birthday reward for Prism products, exclusive Silver discounts and offers, free shipping for 2 orders
Gold  | Spend £50 within a year |  Welcome/birthday reward for Prism products, exclusive Gold discounts and offers, free shipping for 4 orders 
Platinum| Paid subscription - £10.99 a year |  Welcome reward, birthday reward, early sale access, exclusive Platinum discounts and offers, access to exclusive brands and items, free unlimited fast-track and nominated day deliveries* (on orders £10 or over) and returns - (*T&C’s apply)

Note: Customers who do not purchase anything for over 1 year will be downgraded from their current tier.
